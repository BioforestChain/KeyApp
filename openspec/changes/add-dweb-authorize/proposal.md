# Change: Add DWEB Authorize Feature

## Status

**HOLD** - Pending DWEB/Plaoc runtime availability.

This proposal documents the complete DWEB authorization system for external app wallet access and transaction signing. Implementation will begin once the DWEB runtime is available for integration testing.

## Why

External DWEB applications need secure access to KeyApp wallet functionality:
1. **Address sharing**: Apps need wallet addresses for displaying balances, receiving payments
2. **Transaction signing**: Apps need user-approved signatures for transfers, messages, and contracts
3. **User consent**: Every operation must be explicitly approved by the user with clear information about what they're authorizing

The mpay implementation contains ~2000 lines across 6 files handling these flows. KeyApp currently has only a 156-line stub (`src/services/authorize/plaoc-adapter.ts`) defining the interface.

## What Changes

### HIGH Priority (This Proposal Scope)

- **Address Authorization Flow**: Complete flow for sharing wallet addresses with external apps
  - Main wallet addresses only (`type: main`)
  - All addresses on a specific chain (`type: network`)
  - All addresses from all wallets (`type: all`)

- **Signature Authorization Flow**: Complete flow for user-approved signing operations
  - Message signing (`type: message`)
  - Transfer signing (`type: transfer`)
  - Destroy/burn operations (`type: destory`)

- **UI Components**: Authorization pages and sheets
  - Address authorization page with app info display
  - Signature authorization page with transaction details
  - Password confirmation sheet for all signing operations

- **IPC Integration**: DWEB communication methods
  - `getCallerAppInfo(eventId)` - Retrieve requesting app manifest
  - `respondWith(eventId, path, data)` - Send authorization result
  - `removeEventId(eventId)` - Cleanup IPC state

- **Router Integration**: New routes for authorization flows
  - `/authorize/address/:id` - Address authorization
  - `/authorize/signature/:id` - Signature authorization

- **Balance Validation**: Pre-signing balance check to prevent failed transactions
  - Verify sufficient balance for transfer amount
  - Verify sufficient balance for transaction fees
  - Display clear error when balance insufficient

### MEDIUM Priority (Deferred)

- Fee calculation with chain-specific logic
- Certificate transfer (`type: bioforestChainCertificateTransfer`)
- JSON object signing (`type: json`)
- Asset balance queries (`type: assetTypeBalance`)

### LOWER Priority (Deferred)

- ENTITY/NFT operations (`type: ENTITY`)
- Smart contract calls (`type: contract`)
- All-chain implementations (beyond main supported chains)
- Secondary password for high-value operations
- Fee randomization for privacy

## Security Boundaries

### Address Authorization

| Exposed | Protected |
|---------|-----------|
| Wallet addresses | Private keys |
| Public keys | Mnemonic phrases |
| Chain names | Password |
| Wallet display names | Transaction history |

**User consent required**: User must explicitly tap "Approve" to share addresses.

### Signature Authorization

| Exposed | Protected |
|---------|-----------|
| Transaction details (amount, recipient) | Private keys |
| Estimated fees | Mnemonic phrases |
| Operation type | Raw signing material |

**User consent required**:
- User must review all transaction details
- Master password required for EVERY signing operation
- No auto-approval mechanism

### App Information Display

Before any authorization, user sees:
- Requesting app name
- Requesting app logo
- Requesting app home URL
- Specific permissions being requested

## IPC Contract Details

### Event ID Format

- **Source**: Generated by DWEB runtime when triggering authorization
- **Format**: `dweb-auth-{uuid}` (opaque string, treat as identifier)
- **Lifetime**: Valid for 5 minutes from creation
- **Single-use**: Each eventId can only be responded to once

### IPlaocAdapter Interface

```typescript
interface IPlaocAdapter {
  getCallerAppInfo(eventId: string): Promise<CallerAppInfo>
  respondWith(eventId: string, path: string, data: unknown): Promise<void>
  removeEventId(eventId: string): Promise<void>
  isAvailable(): boolean
}

interface CallerAppInfo {
  appId: string      // DWEB app identifier
  appName: string    // Display name
  appIcon: string    // Icon URL
  origin: string     // App home URL
}
```

### Response Paths & Schemas

| Path | Success Data | Error Data |
|------|--------------|------------|
| `/auth/address` | `{ addresses: AddressInfo[] }` | `{ error: 'rejected' \| 'timeout' }` |
| `/auth/signature` | `{ signature: string, txHash?: string }` | `{ error: 'rejected' \| 'timeout' \| 'insufficient_balance' }` |

### Error Codes

| Code | Meaning | User Action |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `rejected` | User clicked Reject | None needed |
| `timeout` | 5-minute timeout elapsed | Retry request |
| `insufficient_balance` | Balance < amount + fee | Add funds |
| `unsupported_chain` | Chain not supported | Use different chain |
| `invalid_event` | EventId not found or expired | Retry request |

## High-Risk Decisions

### 1. Unknown Chain/Network Handling

**Decision**: Return `unsupported_chain` error immediately.

- System SHALL check if requested `chainName` is in supported chains list
- If unsupported: display error page with i18n key `authorize.error.unknownChain`
- User can dismiss and return home; no partial authorization

**Rationale**: Better to fail fast than attempt unsupported operations.

### 2. Request Expiration Strategy

**Decision**: 5-minute timeout with cleanup.

- Authorization requests expire 5 minutes after `getCallerAppInfo` is called
- On timeout: system auto-responds with `{ error: 'timeout' }`
- UI dismisses automatically with toast notification
- `removeEventId` called for cleanup

**Rationale**: Prevents stale requests, balances UX with security.

### 3. Replay Prevention

**Decision**: Single-use eventId with mandatory cleanup.

- Each `eventId` can only receive ONE `respondWith` call
- After `respondWith`, `removeEventId` MUST be called
- Duplicate `respondWith` calls are no-ops (idempotent)
- Mock adapter tracks used eventIds in Set for testing

**Rationale**: Prevents replay attacks, ensures deterministic behavior.

### 4. Balance Validation Timing

**Decision**: Pre-signing validation, not at submission.

- Balance check happens BEFORE password prompt
- If insufficient: "Confirm" button disabled, error shown
- User cannot bypass by entering password
- Rechecks on retry (user may have received funds)

**Rationale**: Better UX than failing after password entry.

## Impact
