# Change: Add receive flow tests

## Why

- ReceivePage already implemented but lacks test coverage
- Ensures existing QR/address display functionality works correctly
- Completes Phase 3 transfer functionality

## What Changes

- Add Vitest tests for ReceivePage (mock services, UI verification)
- Add Storybook stories for receive flow variations
- Validate existing implementation

## Impact

- **Tests**: Add coverage for existing receive page
- **No new components**: Page already complete
- **Estimated scope**: ~15 min (testing only)
